# Project State: Milestone v2.0

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (initiated 2026-09-13)  
Blueprint: `docs/training-programs-physique-gamification-plan-2026-09-10.md`

**Core value:** Safe, deterministic, and explainable training program generation; flexible program and wave editing; persistent Dream Physique goals with phased nutrition plans; and an authentic 15-tier XP gamification system.  
**Current focus:** Phase 21 — crossfit-gpp-training-tracks

## Session update — 2026-09-26 (Phase 21 Plan 03 Completed)

- Completed Plan 21-03 (CF-01, CF-02): Duration cap estimator + prerequisite metadata gap:
  - Added `WorkoutDurationEstimator.estimateCappedSegment(capSeconds)`, returning the cap verbatim as a conservative upper bound for AMRAP/EMOM/For-Time metcon segments (TDD RED/GREEN), composing with `estimateSession`'s existing `Iterable<Duration>` parameter with no signature change.
  - Closed the `prerequisiteSlugs` metadata gap RESEARCH.md identified: `kipping-muscle-up`/`strict-muscle-up` now gated on `pull-up`/`chest-dips` (mirroring `bar-muscle-up`); all 6 Olympic-tagged lifts (`power-clean`, `hang-power-clean`, `clean-and-jerk`, `power-snatch`, `hang-snatch`, `squat-snatch`) now gated on `front-squat`/`overhead-press`.
  - Extended `test/exercise_scaling_resolver_test.dart` with a `CrossFit prerequisite gating (CF-02)` group proving `ExerciseProgrammingEligibility.verifyPrerequisites` correctly gates a novice with no history and admits one with completed prerequisites.
- Validation: 0 analyzer errors; `test/features/workouts/workout_duration_estimator_test.dart` and `test/exercise_scaling_resolver_test.dart` both fully passing (17/17 combined).
- Next implementation focus: Plan 21-04 (Wave 2, blocked on Wave 1 completion — 21-04/21-05 remain).

## Session update — 2026-09-26 (Phase 21 Plan 01 Completed)

- Completed Plan 21-01 (CF-01): `SessionSegment` schema primitive:
  - Added `SessionSegment` enum (warmup/skill/strength/metcon/cooldown) and the shared public `CrossfitSlotNeed` descriptor in `lib/features/programs/domain/session_segment.dart`, kept separate from either Wave 2 planner file so `crossfit_program_planner.dart` (21-04) and `gpp_program_planner.dart` (21-05) stay file-independent.
  - Bumped drift `schemaVersion` to 44: `sessionSegment` on `ProgramExerciseSlots`/`ProgramDayExercises`, `supersetGroup` on `ProgramDayExercises`, `plannedSessionSegment` on `WorkoutExercises`, with a guarded `addIfMissing` onUpgrade branch.
  - All five schema-bump chores done: codegen regenerated (`drift_schema_v44.json`, `schema_v44.dart`, `database.g.dart`), `test/migration_test.dart` retargeted to v44 with a new v43->v44 replay test, and matching `supabase/migrations/20260916000000_session_segment_v44.sql`.
- Validation: 0 analyzer errors; `test/migration_test.dart` 17/17 passing. Full `flutter test` run: 1334 passed, 7 pre-existing failures in `test/schema_v25_test.dart`/`schema_v27_test.dart`/`schema_v28_test.dart`/`schema_v29_test.dart` (stale hardcoded v39 targets, predates this plan — logged to `.planning/phases/21-crossfit-gpp-training-tracks/deferred-items.md`, not fixed — out of scope).
- Next implementation focus: Plan 21-02.

## Session update — 2026-09-13 (Phase 16 Completed)

- Completed Phase 16: `Exercise Programming Metadata & Discipline Taxonomy`:
  - **Plan 16-01 (META-01):** Shipped Drift & Supabase schema v41 with 6 new metadata columns and scaling index, verified TableMigration table rewrite, generated migration fixtures and dumped schema snapshot, and packaged `exercise_programming_metadata.json` in `pubspec.yaml`.
  - **Plan 16-02 (META-01, META-03):** Upgraded `exercise_programming_metadata.json` to version 2 covering 108 exercises across 5 canonical disciplines (`weights`, `calisthenics`, `crossfit`, `olympic`, `gpp`), 4 commonness tiers, 7 scaling ladders, and specialization anchors; extended `ExerciseImporter` companion mapping; hardened `ExerciseProgrammingEligibility.allows` with strict novice difficulty ceiling and two-layer `basicWeights` hard gate blocking specialty bars, chains, boards, and pins.
  - **Plan 16-03 (META-02, META-04):** Implemented dual-check prerequisite gate in `ExerciseProgrammingEligibility.verifyPrerequisites` with canonical `movementSlug` family alias resolution; built `ExerciseScalingResolver` domain service with progressive ladder regression, strict group boundaries, and explainable rationales.
- Validation: 0 Dart static analysis errors; 46/46 automated tests passing across 6 test suites in 15s.
- Next implementation focus: `/gsd-plan-phase 17` (Deterministic Program Planner & Hard Guardrails).
